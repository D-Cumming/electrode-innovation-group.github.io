In 2019 we saw the transit of a comet's tail in broadband light in another stellar system, Beta Pictoris {% cite 2019A&A...625L..13Z %}. The sensitivity of the TESS satellite enabled the detection of the distinctive shark's tooth shape predicted over 20 years earlier by Lecavelier Des Etangs.

The star itself is a Delta Scuti pulsator, ringing like a bell due to an internal pulsation driven by the Kappa-mechanism. Over 35 separate frequencies were removed from the light curve to reveal the shape of three exocomets during the 2019 TESS observations.

A later paper {% cite 2022NatSR..12.5855L %} discovered an additional 27 exocomet transits over a total of 156 days, enabling a power law fit to the size distribution of the exocomets and showing similarities to those in our own Solar system.
