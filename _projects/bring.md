## Looking at one star continuously for almost two years

In 2017 and the start of 2018, the circumplanetary environment of the gas giant exoplanet Beta Pictoris b crossed in front of the bright young star Beta Pictoris, a naked eye 4th magnitude star in the Southern skies. We wanted to see if any circumplanetary material crossed in front of the star over this 300 day period, and so I started the bRing project.

The _Beta Pictoris b ring (bRing)_ project are two small robotic observatories in South Africa and Australia {% cite 2017A&A...607A..45S %}, each one consists of two telephoto lenses with support computers so that we can continuously monitor the path of Beta Pictoris across the Southern skies. The design builds on the heritage gained in Leiden from the MASCARA all sky survey camera units. To get longitudinal coverage, two separate bRing cameras were built (one by Leiden Observatory for South Africa and one by University of Rochester for Australia) and the data is combined with MASCARA South to provide redundant photometric coverage. The photometric precision is 0.5% with 5 minutes of data.

The project successfully monitored the Hill sphere transit of Beta Pictoris b and we placed an upper limit to the amount of dust and an absence of rings {% cite 2021A&A...648A..15K %}.

Several other papers have been produced from the observatories, including the discovery of a transiting exoplanet {% cite 2020A&A...635A..60D %}, a variable star catalog {% cite 2019ApJS..244...15M %}.

The South African observatory survived a huge hail storm that took out several other observatories, and the Australian observatory had the power supplies shorted out by ants(!)

Ant attack! The ants got into the Australian box and shorted out the UPS electronics, requiring replacement components and an anti-ant defence border (a.k.a. more glue and sealant).
