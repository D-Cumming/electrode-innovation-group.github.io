My group works on the [direct imaging of extrasolar planets and their characterisation](projects/yses/), the [transits of giant ring systems](projects/j1407b/) in archival data, the search for exomoons and [exocomets](projects/exocomets/), and building and testing novel [(and not so novel)](projects/pinhole/) instrumentation.

I support open science by publishing my latest research papers using the Showyourwork! reproducible framework, and I regularly post about my astronomical research on social media.
