I enjoy teaching, especially when I can break down a difficult topic into simpler parts and explain how it all fits back together as a whole. Relating abstract concepts to more everyday experiences means that I typically use props to convey concepts, such as tone generators to demonstrate heterodyne radio receivers, and wooden marble games to explain how digital cameras work.
